## Description

Miam bebe is a Baby's nutrition tracker. It allows parents to keep track of what they give to their babies on a weekly basis, keeping track of their intolerances, introduction of foods, reaction to them, dates,...

Parents introduced the initial food goals for the following week, and during the week they'll submit the foods they are giving to their babies. They'll see the progress of their babies nutrition for that week, and plan accordingly the remaining meals. 

Parents will receive a notification at the middle of the week, with the current status of the week, the nutrition progress, and some recip ideas for the remaining meals.

They can access the full agenda where all the weeks and their information are stored. 

They can also store receipts for future insipiration and share those with other parents. 

Parents will receive tips of nutrition randomly.
